# basic-python-learning-projects
A collection og small Python programs created as part of my step-by-step learning. 
I am not an experienced programmer - this respitory is meant to document any progress, mistakes and hopefully improvements over time.
Each file represents a small exercise og challenge, starting from very basic concepts and gradually moving towards more advances logic.

Programs
1. 01_hello_python.py -> takes a name input and provides present time
2. 02_ultra_simple_calc.py -> simple calculator just multiplying to numbers, good way to describe the basics how a function works -> something in - something else out
3. 03_odd_or_even.py -> checks if a number is odd or even
4. 04_highest_number.py -> takes 3 space separated digits, and provides the highest one
5. 05_age_comment.py -> takes an input age and tells you what you are (I am glad I am still just an adult;)
6. 06_guess_number.py - simple guessing-number game
7. 07_guess_number_log.py -> still simple guessing-number-game, only this time it logs the number of attempts
8. 08_guess_game.py -> Still a simple guessing-number-gamne, now with logging and best score --> Still needs some refreshing.

   Further plans is to make these programs more advanced, as I see potential growth.
   Next step:
   -> input validation with try/except
   -> add a test mode for easier dedbugging during coding
   -> explore more advanced logic code structuring
